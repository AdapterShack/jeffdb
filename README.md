# JEFFDB: Jeff's Essentially Feature-Free Database

This is an unviably minimal implementation of a document oriented database.

Features (or lack thereof):

* Only JSON is supported.
* All data is stored as JSON files written directly to the filesystem. 
* Files are organized into "collections",ie., directories on the filesystem.
* Files are simply named after id + ".json" where "id" is either provided or autogenerated.
* Yes, the id field must literally be named "id".
* Getting an object by its ID is simply asking the server to read that one file by name.
* Getting an object by any other field, scans every file in the directory. In RDMS terms, every select is a table scan, and there are no indexes.
* In the REST API, querying is limited to exact matching on one or more fields (using as a Java API is not subject to this limitation)
* No attempt ever to lock anything or be safe for concurrent uses - we assume only one user at a time (if even one).

You probably should not use this as a database. It was written mainly as an exercise in
developing an extremely small Spring Boot project.

This may be run as a standalone web app which provides a REST API, or embedded in another project as JAR file (only recommended if your data storage needs are truly minimal).

## Running

It's Spring Boot, so you can just run it with gradle:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Alternatively, you can build it and then run the JAR file directly:

```
./gradlew build
java -jar build/libs/jeffdb-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Either of these will result in an instance listening on port 8080 and storing all files under an automatically created ".jeffdb.data" subdirectory of whatever directory you were in when you started it.

## REST API

Read from collection "foo":

```
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/foo
```

Append to collection:

```
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/foo -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"jeff"}'
```

Get object by ID:

```
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/foo/cef576a881b4419aaf63f0fc7d7a8ec8
```

Update by ID:

```
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/foo/cef576a881b4419aaf63f0fc7d7a8ec8 -X PUT -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Jeff R."}'
```

Find by other field(s):

```
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/foo/search -X POST -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Jeff R."}'
```

Delete by ID:

```
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/foo/cef576a881b4419aaf63f0fc7d7a8ec8 -X DELETE
```

Delete by other fields:

```
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/foo/search -X DELETE -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"name":"Jeff R."}'
```

Delete entire collection:

```
curl -i -s http://localhost:8080/foo -X DELETE
```

## As a library

All of the functions illustrated above can be done by calling `com.adaptershack.jeffdb.DatabaseService` directly from code.

```
DatabaseService db = new DatabaseService();

// set whatever directory you want the files to go in
db.setRootDirectory(root);

// whatever instance of Jackson's ObjectMapper your project already uses
db.setObjectMapper(objectMapper);

// junk up some data
ObjectNode node = objectMapper.createObjectNode();
node.put("a", 1);
node.put("b", 2);

// insert it in there
JsonNode inserted = db.insert("foo", node);

// run arbitrary queries
JsonNode results = db.list("foo", (obj) -> obj.get("b").asInt() > obj.get("a").asInt() );

// serialize any object that has getters/setters for a String "id"

IdHavingObject obj = new IdHavingObject();
obj.setName("jeff");

IdHavingObject insertedObj = db.insert("baz", obj);

String id = insertedObj.getId();

List<IdHavingObject> list =
		db.list("baz", IdHavingObject.class, o -> o.getName().equalsIgnoreCase("jeff"));

		
```
